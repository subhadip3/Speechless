# Speechless
Quite often in a big classroom setting students are hesitant to ask their doubts to the teacher.
This hinders his understanding and ultimately he loses track of the subsequent topics as well. A
periodic feedback is also useful for the teacher to be sure that his ideas are getting through to
the students as intended. This app is our humble attempt to make the classroom experience more
interactive and dynamic.
Although, there are several apps that try to remedy this but almost all of them require the
students and teacher to be connected to the Internet, for the exchange of information throughout
the duration. Since the standard routers can handle only so much, most practical systems fail
to serve the intended purpose. This leads to students losing the network connection time and
again. Our android app on the other hand circumvents this constraint by providing access to wifi
to students in a round robin fashion, thus ensuring proper connectivity for all.
